# Metro For Steam Auto-Updater
Automatically updates the Steam Metro skin by BoneyardBrew: http://metroforsteam.com/. Should work on all versions of Windows, as long as you have .NET 4.5.2 or higher installed. Please report any issues or bugs ;)

## Features
- Downloads the latest version of the skin, and extracts it to your steam skins folder.
- Automatically detects your steam install location.
- Does not overwrite your custom.styles -- unless the updated package contains a newer version.
